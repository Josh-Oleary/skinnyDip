# skinnyDip

A full CRUD application for swimming holes and hot springs.

I used MongoDB and mongoose with Node.js and Express to creat my application. 

I have not yet deployed the project. To check the project out in your local invironment follow these steps:

1- download master file to your local directory
2- unzip contents into an empty folder
3- open up your terminal, check out the package.json file and download all dependencies
4- once all dependencies have been downloaded, navigate to the project folder
5- enter the following command in your terminal: node app.js
6- enjoy!
